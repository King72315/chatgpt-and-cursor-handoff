# RiRi ↔ Mariah Handoff

Shared project status for RiRi (ChatGPT) and Mariah (Cursor).

RiRi plans the work and reviews results. Mariah implements the work in this repository. This file is the current status. GitHub Issues are the task thread.

## Repository

- Name: `chatgpt-and-cursor-handoff`
- Owner: `King72315`
- Link: https://github.com/King72315/chatgpt-and-cursor-handoff
- Issues: https://github.com/King72315/chatgpt-and-cursor-handoff/issues

## Roles

- **RiRi (ChatGPT):** Write the plan. Open one GitHub Issue per task. Review Mariah's result comment on that same issue.
- **Mariah (Cursor):** Do the coding and implementation. Do not expand the task beyond the issue. When the task is done, comment on that same issue with the results, update this file, and push.

## Current project status

- Project folder: `Chatgpt and Cursor Handoff`
- Application code: none. This repository is the shared communication project only.
- Active task: Issue 53 pickup received. ChurchEdge native mobile migration assessment is read-only and has not finished. No application files have been changed.
- Standing instruction: Cursor user rule "RiRi–Mariah GitHub workflow" (id 18434501). It applies in every project on this Cursor account.
- Branch: `master`
- Last update: 2026-10-15

## Important decisions

1. GitHub Issues are the communication channel. One issue per task. Results go on that same issue so RiRi can review them in place.
2. This file holds current status, important decisions, and the latest handoff. Mariah updates it after each completed task and pushes the change.
3. RiRi's issue should include the goal, scope, what must stay unchanged, and acceptance criteria.
4. Mariah's completion comment should include what changed, files touched, how it was checked, and any blocker.
5. Setup work does not change application functionality or unrelated project files.
6. The repository is public so RiRi can open the handoff file and the issues from the links in this file.
7. The workflow is a Cursor user rule, so it applies when any development project is opened. It is not a background watcher. Mariah checks GitHub when a Cursor session starts.

## How RiRi assigns a task

Open a GitHub Issue with:

- **Title:** short task name
- **Goal:** what should be true when the task is done
- **Scope:** what to change, and what to leave alone
- **Acceptance criteria:** how RiRi will judge the result
- **Notes:** files, constraints, or context Mariah needs

## How Mariah reports results

Comment on the same issue with:

- What was completed
- Files changed
- How it was verified
- Follow-ups or blockers

Then update **Current project status**, **Latest handoff**, and **Status log** in this file and push.

## Latest handoff

- **Date:** 2026-10-14
- **From:** Mariah
- **To:** RiRi
- **Summary:** The Lab copies the six Winner model signals from the frozen feature vector: ranking, surface, recent form, serve and return, head-to-head, and rest. It also copies the Value Winner price, book, and odds time. Calculated outputs such as win probability and value edge are kept separate and are not marked correct because the pick won. Signals that were not on the original freeze stay unavailable. October 14 picks are unchanged. No new phone build.
- **Issue:** https://github.com/King72315/chatgpt-and-cursor-handoff/issues/50
- **API deployment:** `9ce24887` on service `tennisedge-api`
- **Save point:** `PRE_THE_LAB_V1` at `forensics/pre-the-lab-v1`
- **Phone:** https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/jKSS_QkwaZb26Qq61ek0BLJhX9ByLzmYIGb2rblSwfY.apk
